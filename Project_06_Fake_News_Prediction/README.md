## Explanation
This project involves predicting whether news stories are likely to be fake using a deep learning model built with TensorFlow. The dataset contains news titles and text, along with labels indicating whether the news is fake or real. The steps include data preprocessing, model definition, compilation, training, and evaluation.

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned by removing irrelevant columns and rows with missing values. Text data is combined, tokenized, and converted into numerical sequences for model input.
- **Model Definition**: A Sequential model is defined with an embedding layer, dense layers, and a batch normalization layer.
- **Model Compilation**: The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.
- **Model Training**: The model is trained with early stopping to prevent overfitting.
- **Model Evaluation**: The training and validation accuracy are plotted to visualize the model's performance.

## Insights
1. **Model Performance**: The model achieved a high validation accuracy, indicating its effectiveness in predicting fake news.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Proper cleaning and preprocessing of text data were crucial for model training.
3. **Early Stopping**: Implementing early stopping helped prevent overfitting and improved model generalization.

## Future Enhancements
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as learning rates, batch sizes, and epochs, to further optimize model performance.
- **Advanced Models**: Implement more advanced models, such as transformer-based architectures like BERT, for potentially better performance.
- **Extended Training**: Increase the number of training epochs and use techniques like early stopping to prevent overfitting and achieve better results.
