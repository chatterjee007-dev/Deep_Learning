## Explanation
This project implements and compares three different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures using the TensorFlow library. The models are trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The three architectures are:

1. **Simple CNN**: A basic CNN architecture with Batch Normalization and Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
2. **Deeper CNN with Dropout**: An extended version of the simple CNN with additional layers and Dropout for regularization.
3. **CNN with Data Augmentation**: A CNN that incorporates data augmentation techniques like random flips, rotations, and zooms to enhance the model's generalization ability.

The models are compiled using the Adam optimizer and trained with the Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss function. Each model's performance is evaluated and compared based on accuracy.

## Insights
1. **Model Comparison**: The Deeper CNN with Dropout achieved the highest accuracy, indicating that deeper architectures with regularization can improve performance.
2. **Effectiveness of Data Augmentation**: The CNN with Data Augmentation showed competitive performance, demonstrating that data augmentation is a valuable technique for enhancing model generalization.
3. **Training and Validation**: The training and validation accuracy trends provided insights into the models' learning behavior and potential areas for further optimization.

## Future Enhancements
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as learning rates, batch sizes, and epochs, to further optimize model performance.
- **Advanced Architectures**: Implement more advanced architectures like ResNet, VGG, or Inception to benchmark against the basic CNN models.
- **Extended Training**: Increase the number of training epochs and use techniques like early stopping to prevent overfitting and achieve better results.
